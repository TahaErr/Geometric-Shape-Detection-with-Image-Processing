# Geometric-Shape-Detection-with-Image-Processing
A Python script using OpenCV for analyzing and identifying geometric shapes in images. It extracts shapes, determines their types (e.g., circle, square), fill status (filled or hollow), and colors. Features noise reduction for improved accuracy. Great for educational and image processing projects.
